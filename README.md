# python3-Reverse-shell
*Inorder to avoid the problems faced with direct connectons we use reverse shell 
*Inorder to maintain long term connection a between victim machine and our machine or server we use  reverse shell connection method
*Here the attackers create a python file (reverse shell) and sends this to victim via email,usb,cd ...etc and when the victim opens this file it creates a reverse connection to attackers machine 
*To have long term  connection try to host a server and bind the server's ip address in victim.py and choose a port numbeber which should be same as it was used in server.py
